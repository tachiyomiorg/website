# Local sources
Frequently Asked Questions about Local sources.

## How Can I Import My Downloaded Series into Tachiyomi?

For a step-by-step process, we recommend referring to [this guide](/docs/guides/local-series/).

## What Should I Do If I Can't Find the Tachiyomi Folder?
In case the **Tachiyomi** folder is not visible, create one using a file manager.

## How Can I Resolve Empty/Blank Covers on My Local Series?
Occasionally, cover images for local series might not appear.

1. Confirm that you've organized the folder structure correctly.
   * To verify, access the series with the missing cover and see if you can read chapters within the app.
   * If not, follow the [provided guide](/docs/guides/local-series/#folder-structure) first.
1. Capture a screenshot of the read chapters, then remove the series from your library.
1. Navigate to **Browse → Settings → Advanced** and tap **Clear database**.
   * This action will only affect series not in your library.
1. Return to **Browse -> Local source** and locate the series.
   * The cover issue should now be resolved.
   * Re-add the series to your library, mark your read chapters, and re-enable tracking if necessary.
