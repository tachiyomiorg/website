Frequently Asked Questions about the Reader.

## Why didn't the page load?
Besides network-related problems, **Tachiyomi** may occasionally fail to recognize certain images.
To address this, simply exit and re-enter the reader, often resolving the issue.

## Can I see two pages at once?
Not currently. Creating an effective dual-page reader that accommodates scanlator page inconsistencies and other complexities poses challenges. This feature may be added in the future.

## What do all the settings do?
For detailed instructions, please consult the guides section on the website [here](/docs/guides/reader-settings).
