## Is Tachiyomi available for iOS/iPadOS?
There is no iOS or iPadOS version and neither are there plans for one.
Porting is difficult due to the separate codebases of iOS and Android apps.

Any app proclaiming to be "**Tachiyomi for iOS**" is not by us and should be treated as a scam.

## What is Tachiyomi Preview?
**Tachiyomi Preview** is a regularly updated beta version of the app.
It showcases potential upcoming features, but it's more prone to bugs and crashes.

Ideal for users seeking the latest **Tachiyomi** experience, it's essential to [enable auto-backup](/docs/guides/backups#enabling-automatic-backups) to prevent library loss due to issues.

## How do I update from the F-Droid builds?
**Tachiyomi** on **F-Droid** lacks official support, updates aren't guaranteed.

To migrate to official builds:

1. Create a backup.
1. Uninstall the **F-Droid** version (discard app data if possible).
1. Download/install **Tachiyomi**.
1. Restore your backup.

Hosting an **F-Droid** repo isn't planned, as **Tachiyomi** manages updates independently, rendering **F-Droid** usage redundant.
Refer to [this GitHub comment](https://github.com/tachiyomiorg/tachiyomi/issues/6736#issuecomment-1059608058) for details.

## Can I read light novels?
**Tachiyomi** can't read light novels; it's an image parser, not a text parser.

**Tachiyomi** isn't designed for anime streaming.

Projects using the **Tachiyomi** name for anime streaming aren't affiliated with the main project.

## What's a fork?
