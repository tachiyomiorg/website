# General
Frequently Asked Questions

## iOS Availability
There is no iOS version and neither are there plans for one.
Porting is difficult due to the separate codebases of iOS and Android apps.

Any app proclaiming to be "**Tachiyomi for iOS**" is not by us and should be treated as a scam.

## Google Play Store Availability
**Tachiyomi** won't be on the **Google Play Store**.

APK-based extensions conflict with [Google Play's content policy](https://play.google.com/about/developer-content-policy/).
**Google** might take down the app due to certain content, which the developers wishes to avoid.

To report **Tachiyomi** copycats on the **Google Play Store**, fill out [this form](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/contact/takedown) following [these steps](https://pastebin.com/08eeuJxH).

## Migrating from F-Droid
**Tachiyomi** on **F-Droid** lacks official support, updates aren't guaranteed.

To migrate to official builds:

1. Create a backup.
1. Uninstall the **F-Droid** version (discard app data if possible).
1. Download/install **Tachiyomi**.
1. Restore your backup.

Hosting an **F-Droid** repo isn't planned, as **Tachiyomi** manages updates independently, rendering **F-Droid** usage redundant.
Refer to [this GitHub comment](https://github.com/tachiyomiorg/tachiyomi/issues/6736#issuecomment-1059608058) for details.

## Light Novels Compatibility
**Tachiyomi** can't read light novels; it's an image parser, not a text parser.

## Anime Streaming
**Tachiyomi** isn't designed for anime streaming.

Projects using the **Tachiyomi** name for anime streaming aren't affiliated with the main project.

## Device Syncing
**Tachiyomi** can't sync between devices.
Use its [backup and restore](/docs/guides/backups) features for series database and content migration to another device.
