# Updated website

We've launched a fully rewritten website with improved usability for both users
and contributors. Some improvements include the [download](/download/) page,
which now doesn't require any new additional requests, and a new [changelogs](/changelogs/)
page to easily see historical app release notes.

This page is part of the new [news](/news/) section, which will be used in occasions
like this to keep you informed of any interesting updates.

Under the hood, we're now using [VitePress](https://vitepress.dev/) with
[Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) v3, replacing our previous usage of
[VuePress](https://vuepress.vuejs.org/).

As we're still in the process of rewritting and updating part of the
documentation and guides, there may still be some errors or outdated content.
If you find any, please report by opening an issue in the [repository for this website](https://github.com/tachiyomiorg/website/issues/new/choose) on GitHub.
