# Backups

Backups are inter-compatible between Tachiyomi versions, with a few exceptions listed under forks information.

## What's in a backup?

Backups can hold the following information:

- **Titles**
- **Categories**
- **Read chapters**
- **Tracking settings**
- **Reading history**
- **Manga information**
  - Author, Artist, Date Added to Library, Selected Viewer, Read Duration, etc.

You can do this by going to **More → Backup and Restore** and then selecting **Create backup** and select a location to save it.

## How do I restore a backup?

Restoring is done from the Backup and Restore settings.

To restore a backup without issues be sure to:

- Log into the Tracking services that you previously used.

## How can I make my new install of Tachiyomi detect my old downloads?

You can transfer downloaded manga chapters from one version of **Tachiyomi** to another.

## How do I make Tachiyomi automatically backup?

It is highly recommended you turn on auto backups, this will ensure you can recover if need be.

You can do this by going to **More → Settings → Backup** and then setting a **backup frequency**.
In the case of a catastrophic failure, at least you will be able to recover.

## Forks information

This fork can only restore **MangaDex** entries in a backup.
If there are entries from other sources that are a part of that backup then they will not transfer.

This fork have some built-in extensions, namely: **E-Hentai**, **Hitomi.la**, and **nHentai** for TachiyomiAZ while TachiyomiSY only has **E-Hentai**.

Titles from said extensions will not be restored when restoring a backup made by these forks to standard Tachiyomi.
It is possible to restore titles to these forks, but it is not possible to back them up out of these forks.

This fork can only restore legacy backups, as it has not made the changes needed to support the new backup yet.
