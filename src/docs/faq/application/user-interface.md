## Can I change the app language?

No.
It was removed due to it causing small bugs everywhere in **Tachiyomi**.
Android does not provide a standard way of selecting a language that's not your device-language.
You can improve the quality of the translations in your language [here](https://hosted.weblate.org/projects/tachiyomi/) or change your system language.
