# Reader

## Why are some images not displayed?

Aside from network issues, sometimes Tachiyomi does not register the image as existing, exit, and re-enter the reader to fix this.

## Will there ever be a dual-page reader option?

The logic required to make a dual-page reader automatically work along with scanlator page inconsistencies and other issues means it is unlikely to be added at this time.
