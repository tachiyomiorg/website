# Source migration

Migration is the process of moving manga from one source to another while keeping your current progress and data. This is used often when a source is no longer accessible or you want to move it off one source to another for a myriad of reasons.

::: guide
1. Go to **[<MaterialIcon icon-name="class"/> My library](/help/guides/my-library)**, open the **<MaterialIcon icon-name="more_vert"/> Overflow menu**, and then tap **<MaterialIcon icon-name="compare_arrows"/> Source migration**.
1. Select the **Source** you're migrating from.
1. Find and select the title that you want to migrate.

   **Tachiyomi** will do a global search of all the sources you have installed and enabled. If you don't find the manga you want, try searching for other titles it might go under.
1. Once you find the manga you want to migrate, select it and then choose which data you want to transfer over, and you're done.
