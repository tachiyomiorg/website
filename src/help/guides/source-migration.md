# Source migration

::: tip
This is useful when the source you are using is taken down or there are no plans to fix it, but it exists on other sources.
:::

Source migration transfers all the data (Chapters, Categories and Tracking) from a bookmarked manga over to the another source.

1. Go to the top right corner of the library and press the triple dots (`⋮`), and tap `Source migration`.
1. Scroll down to the source you're transferring from and tap `SELECT`.
1. Scroll down to the title you're transferring and tap that. Tachiyomi will do a global search of all the sources you have installed and enabled. Change the search query if you're not able to find the manga you want.
1. Once you find the manga you want, you just tap it, check the parts of the manga data you want to transfer over, and you're done.
