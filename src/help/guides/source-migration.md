# Source migration

Migration is the process of moving manga between sources without losing progress. This is most often used when a source is no longer accessible or another source is more up-to-date.

::: c-warning
Always make sure to have a [backup](/help/guides/creating-backups/) in case anything unexpected occurs.
:::

::: c-warning
Downloaded chapter(s) do not transfer with migrations.

Migrations with downloaded chapter(s) may leave the download behind. You will need to remove these manually with a file manager.
