# Advanced
The features in this section mostly relate to keeping entries up to date or clearing unnecessary things from the app.

## Clear chapter cache
This setting clears the cache of images from the app. Tachiyomi auto clears the cache when it reaches a certain threshold.

## Clear cookies
This setting clears all cookies from Tachiyomi and the WebView browser. Doing so may log you out of tracking services and other parts of the app that use cookies to log in to the site, such as MangaDex.

## Clear database
This function removes entries of manga that are not in the library. It is useful for correcting any errors that have updated yet.

## Refresh library metadata
This setting refreshes entries in the library to the latest version from the source. It updates the cover, genre, description, and the complete status of the entry.

## Refresh tracking metadata
This setting refreshes all tracking info to the most recent version grabbed from the tracking service, such as completed status, rating, and the last chapter read number.
