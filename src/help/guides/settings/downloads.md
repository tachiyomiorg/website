# Downloads
This category of settings allows you to change the limitations and behaviour of downloads as well as enabling automatic downloads.

The blue badges next to titles is how we indicate the default option, a yellow badge can be used to indicate if for example the feature isn't yet available in the public release.

## Downloads directory <Badge text="/storage/emulated/0/Tachiyomi/downloads" type="default-indicator" vertical="middle"/>
This setting allows you to set where downloads are to be read from and downloaded to. There are some premade locations to download to, and also a custom option that allows you to select a folder that the download folder will be placed, but is only supported on Android 5 and newer.

## Only download over Wi-Fi <Badge text="True" type="default-indicator" vertical="middle"/>
This setting makes the [Download new chapters](#download-new-chapters) option only download when you're connected to Wi-Fi, and not data.

## Remove when marked as read <Badge text="False" type="default-indicator" vertical="middle"/>
This setting removes a downloaded chapter after you've used the <Navigation item="old_overflow"/> and marked it as read.

## Remove after read <Badge text="Disabled" type="default-indicator" vertical="middle"/>
This setting removes a downloaded chapter after you've reached the last page and exited the reader.

## Download new chapters <Badge text="False" type="default-indicator" vertical="middle"/>
This setting downloads new chapters as they show up in library updates.

## Categories to include in download <Badge text="All" type="default-indicator" vertical="middle"/>
If there are categories that you would like to exclude from being downloaded, use this setting to check the ones you only want included for downloads. Defaults to all categories being included for downloads.
